`brain-cockpit` is a web-app comprising a Typescript front-end and a Python back-end. It is meant to help explore:

- large surface fMRI datasets projected on surface meshes
- alignments computed between brains, such as those computed with [fugw](https://alexisthual.github.io/fugw/index.html)

ðŸš€ You can try our [online demo](https://brain-cockpit.tc.humanbrainproject.eu/) displaying the [Individual Brain Charting dataset](https://individual-brain-charting.github.io/docs/), a vast collection of fMRI protocols collected in a small number of human participants.
This project was deployed with [EBRAINS](https://www.ebrains.eu/).
